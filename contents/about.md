My name is Jason Wilson and I'm a front-end developer who loves thinking about the web. I live in <em>Birmingham, Alabama</em>.

I currently work at <a href="http://daxko.com">Daxko</a> as part of the design team. I'm not currently looking for other work, but feel free to peruse my <a href="/resume">résumé</a>.

You can find me in many places across the web, typically under the pseudonym scurker. Feel free to contact me on <a href="http://twitter.com/scurker">twitter</a> or via <a href="jason@scurker.com">email</a>.

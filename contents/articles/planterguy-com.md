I'm proud to add [planterguy.com](http://planterguy.com) to my portfolio! Planterguy is the blog of Guy Walker who works with the [Association of Related Churches](http://www.relatedchurches.com/).

I was more than happy to put together this wordpress theme for Guy Walker and wanted a "dirty" feel to go along with the name "planterguy". Theme was built from the ground up and includes several custom widgets tuned for Guy Walker's needs.
